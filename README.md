> 🏆 **Accepted for publication in the 2026 2nd International Conference on Financial Innovation and Marketing Management (FIMM).**

This repository provides a high-performance framework for pricing USD Drop-Back Certificates. It implements a comparative analysis between traditional numerical methods (Monte-Carlo) and a machine learning-based surrogate model (Multi-Layer Perceptron).

## 🔑 Core Methodology
- **Stochastic Engine:** 50,000-path Monte-Carlo simulation under Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to establish pricing benchmarks.
- **Surrogate Modeling:** A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained on the simulation results to learn the complex mapping between market parameters and instrument value.
- **Computational Efficiency:** The AI surrogate achieves microsecond-level inference latency, providing a massive speedup over traditional simulations while maintaining numerical convergence.
